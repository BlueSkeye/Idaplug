Any source code file that is to be copied to the target project directory must be in the
root directory of this program. Should the copy be done in a subdirectory of the target
project directory this is to be handled in the vstemplate file using the TargetFileName
attribute.

Additionally it looks like the file must be referenced by the resulting project file
otherwise it is not copied to the target project.
