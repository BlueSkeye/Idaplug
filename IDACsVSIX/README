This folder contains integration packages for Visual Studio 2012.
The IdaNetBuilder program should be able to build the latest version
of the integration package, provided a non Express version (either
VS2010 or VS2012) is installed on your machine. For those that don't
own such a licence, we provide an already built version of the package.

Starting with revision 30 the IdaNetBuilder detects the lack of elements
required to build the integration package and will automatically
attempt to download the latest package version from SourceForge.

Notwithstanding wether the IdaNetBuilder built it by itself or
downloaded it, the package will be stored under
%LOCALAPPDATA%\idaplug\bin directory. Just double click the package
to install it.
